- **Page**: `/forgot-password` 
- User enters email address
- System validates if email exists in database
- Sends OTP to user's email via Supabase Auth

### 2. **OTP Verification & Password Reset**
- **Page**: `/verify-otp?email={email}`
- User enters 6-digit OTP received in email  
- User creates new password with confirmation
- System verifies OTP and updates password

### 3. **Sign-in Integration**
- Added "Forgot password?" link in sign-in form
- Seamless navigation between pages

## üîß Supabase Configuration Required:

### **Dashboard Settings** (Required for OTP to work):

1. **Go to Authentication > Settings in your Supabase Dashboard**

2. **Enable Password Reset**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Enable email confirmations for password resets
   ```

3. **Configure Email Templates** (Optional - for custom styling):

   ```
   You can customize the email template to match your brand.

4. **Site URL Configuration**:
   ```

   Additional Redirect URLs:
   - http://localhost:3000/reset-password
   - http://localhost:3000/verify-otp
   ```

## üìß Email Template Configuration:

The default Supabase email will contain a 6-digit OTP code. Users will:

2. Enter OTP on your website 
3. Set new password on your website

## üõ† Technical Implementation Details:

### **API Functions Added**:
- `sendPasswordResetOTP(email)` - Sends OTP to user email
- `verifyPasswordResetOTP(email, token, newPassword)` - Verifies OTP and updates password  
- `updateUserPassword(newPassword)` - Updates user password

### **React Hooks Added**:
- `useSendPasswordResetOTP()` - Mutation for sending OTP
- `useVerifyPasswordResetOTP()` - Mutation for OTP verification and password update
- `useUpdatePassword()` - Mutation for password updates

### **Validation Schemas Added**:
- `ForgotPasswordValidation` - Email validation
- `OTPVerificationValidation` - 6-digit OTP validation  
- `ResetPasswordValidation` - Password confirmation validation

### **Pages Created**:
- `/forgot-password` - Email input page
- `/verify-otp` - OTP verification and new password page
- `/reset-password` - Redirect handler for email links

## üöÄ User Experience:

### **Happy Path**:
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on sign-in page
2. User enters email on forgot password page
3. User receives OTP in email
4. User enters OTP on verification page
5. User enters new password (with confirmation)  
6. Password is updated successfully
7. User is redirected to sign-in with success message

### **Error Handling**:
- Email not found in database
- Invalid or expired OTP
- Password confirmation mismatch
- Network/API errors
- Proper user feedback for all error states

## üîç Testing the Flow:

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Steps**:
   - Go to `/sign-in`
   - Click "Forgot password?"
   - Enter a valid email from your users table
   - Check email for OTP (6-digit code)
   - Enter OTP on verification page
   - Set new password
   - Verify you can sign in with new password

## ‚ö° Production Deployment:

1. **Update Site URL** in Supabase Dashboard:
   ```
   Site URL: https://your-domain.com
   Additional Redirect URLs:
   - https://your-domain.com/reset-password
   - https://your-domain.com/verify-otp
   ```

2. **Email Provider**: Supabase uses their own email service by default. For production, consider configuring a custom SMTP provider for better deliverability.
